[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/statcheck)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=statcheck)

The `statcheck` package is aimed at extracting statistical values from articles
and recomputing the _p_ values.

The `statcheck()` function and related `checkPDF()` and `checkPDFdir()`
functions can be used to extract statistical references from articles. The original
_p_ values are reported but also recomputed. This can be useful for both meta
analysis and to see if the reported _p_ values are correct.
